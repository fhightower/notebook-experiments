# Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks capturing thoughts and explorations.

## Usage

To start jupyter lab, run:

```
docker-compose run --rm jupyter
```

### Clojure

This is not yet enabled.

### Javascript

Local use of javascript in Jupyter Lab is limited (see [https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3748](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3748)).

If one needs to use javascript locally, open a notebook as a classic notebook and it should work.
